# Convolution_codes
Include codes of Pneumonia, Normal classification of chest x_ray.
If wanted to integrate GUI to it, then one should download the weights from this code and include that .h5 file to their code.
The part of unique approach shows the smotting technique used for image to generate the pattern as per k-means algorithm or similar algorithm used for the smote.
